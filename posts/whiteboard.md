descriptionLong:
  - Working with partners from the Tuck School of Business' startup incubation program, I worked on a team creating a modern productivity application with a focus on centralized information and deep integrations with existing solutions. I worked on the project during alpha development and product validation, although the product has since gone public.
  - My role on the project was implemening calendar integrations with common calendar providers (e.g. Outlook, Google). Each provider represents its internal data differently and implements different standards, so I focused a significant amount of my time creating wrappers around each provider, and creating converters to convert each data type into a form that the application could understand. I also worked with other engineers to create the required OAuth2 flows to fetch data from each provider.
  - Additionally, I worked on the calendar event creation and synchronization flow. Users are able to create calendar events within other calendars in the application, and I again worked on the converters and OAuth2 flow that would ensure that the events were created and synchronized correctly with the remote provider.
