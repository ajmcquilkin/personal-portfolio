descriptionLong:
  - This project was completed in collaboration with the New Hampshire House of Representatives as part of an initiative to increase a sense of community for youth within the state. The house identified volunteering as a primary method community growth, and my team's role was to design and create a centralized database of volunteer opportunities across the state. Currently organizations looking for volunteers need to market these positions on their own, which both decreases the visilility of these opportunities and means many vital positions don't get filled.
  - "To do this, we first conducted user research into the targeted demographics of the platform. We would need three tiers of users for an MVP: users looking for volunteer opportunites, organizations looking to fill volunteer roles, and site admins from the state managing the program. We determined that extreme simplicity of use would be vital, since many of the organizational and admin level users either didn't have a technical background or didn't have the resources for managing a complex listing flow."
  - Once we had determined the specific needs of the project, we worked with our partners and potential users to ensure we created a useable site MVP by the end of our contract. A major challenge within the site was making sure the codebase would be maintainable by the state after we handed off the project. Because of this, we spent a significant amount of effort in code organization and documentation.
  - Our MVP we created for the partners is currently being managed by the state government as part of the volunteering initiative, and is slated for release at the conclusion of the program.
