descriptionLong:
  - Course election at any school is a vital element of students' educational experience, and without adequate planning resources students will struggle to find their way through their time at college. Dartmouth College suffers from this issue. The college provides highly limited planning resources to students, and these resources are complex and hard to use.
  - Coming into Dartmouth, I struggled finding my path through school. Because of this, I worked with a friend from my freshman floor to create an intuitive, full-featured course planning suite that empowers students to make the best of their educational experience.
  - After conducting extensive user research, we pitched our idea to a startup incubator and won a 20-week development contract with a local software lab to implement our project. From this we created and launched our first iteration of the suite in Fall 2019.
  - We have since acquired a campus course review site, and we're working on integrating its functionality into the next version of our application.
