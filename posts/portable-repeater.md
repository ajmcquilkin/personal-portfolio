descriptionLong:
  - Establishing communication is a vital safety and preparedness measure for first responders when responding to an emergent situation. This is often done with portable radio communication units (think walkie-talkies), and this is very effective in the front country. The issue for backcountry responders or responders in a disaster area with damaged communication networks is that terrain is often not conducive to this required long-distance communication.
  - This is a notable concern for wilderness responders in New Hampshire, which contains the White Mountain range. Vast swaths of this region are designated as wilderness areas, meaning no communication infrastructure can be constructed or maintained. Even though local response groups maintain radio repeaters outside of these wilderness areas, there are large so-called "dead zones" due to the moutainous terrain.
  - In consultation with New Hampshire Fish and Game, my team worked on a proof of concept portable radio repeater which would mitiate the effects of these dead zones. Our repeater would be carried into a zone without reliable radio communication paths and would serve as a middleman for radio broadcasts within the area. The repeater needed to be highly weather resistant, needed to be able to be set up in under 30 minutes, and needed to be able to be carried by a single responder.
